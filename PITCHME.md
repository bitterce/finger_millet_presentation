### Introduction

### Objective

- Allopolyploidie poses many challenges in finding true variants, due to the high number of homeologs between the subgenomes
- Finger millet is a tetrapolyploid crop species, with subgenome A and subgenome B
- EAGLE-RC is able to map reads to the subgenomes seperately and evaluates the likelihood of the data under a given hypothesis
